# C_Assignments_1st_Semester
My University Assignments for the first Semester - Introduction to Programming in C

Table of contents:
  1. A program that counts the amount of primes within a range using brute force or the Millerâ€“Rabin primality test Note: the miller rabin based algorithm is designed to be used for numbers greater than 67 (both versions are deterministic)
  2. A simple version of the bc linux program (basic CLI calculator)
  3. A program that calculates and prints the lower cost(smaller) distance between all the nodes of a graph using only the connection table with the floyd warshall algorythm in 3 different implementations (recursive, recursive with memoization, and dynamic programming)
  4. An AI using the minimax algorythm that plays hex against a human - can be slightly modded to compete against similar AIs
